### PROBLEM STATEMENT:



 Employees, staff members or students in an institute face issues in searching a staff member throughout cabin rooms. Even though one finds a cabin, it isn’t necessary that he/she finds him/her. To address the discussed issues, we propose a solution that can check the availability of a staff member in his/her cabin.



___

### APPROACH:



 To build the proposed system we will use radio frequency identification (RFID) technology. RFID tag will be attached to a person’s possessions like ID card, cellular phone or dial of a watch.  
An RFID reader is attached at the entrance of every staff room. As the person enters in a staff room, the RFID reader reads the id associated with RFID tag. We will build web application which can provide the availability information in real time.



___

### FUTURE ASPECTS:



 This product could be distributed among institutions and companies that could be used to check the presence of employees.
